                  logging. Some browsers require that public certificates issued for your domain

                  A certificate enters status PENDING_VALIDATION upon being requested, unless
                  it fails for any of the reasons given in the troubleshooting topic Certificate
                  request fails (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-failed.html).
                  ACM makes repeated attempts to validate a certificate for 72 hours and then
                  times out. If a certificate shows status FAILED or VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT,
                  delete the request, correct the issue with DNS validation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html)
                  or Email validation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/email-validation.html),
                  and try again. If validation succeeds, the certificate enters status ISSUED.
